## About

This is a project I built a while ago to organize data.  I didn't completely finish this project but it has a lot of good 
infrustructure code in it, which makes this project a good example of what a working nodejs server might look like.

## Important Details

You will have to run **npm install** before you can start the server.

Run this project by navigating to bin/ and running **node server.js**.

Access the running server by going to **localhost:3000** in your browser of choice.


- May your pursuit of knowledge be fruitful :)
